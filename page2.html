    <h1>Billy & His Friends Page 2</h1>
    <h2>Here is a Picture of Billy's Friend Martin :D</h2>
    <img src="Martin.jpg" alt="Martin" height="600">
    <h2>Say Hello To Martin, Kids! He's a bit shy :D</h2>
    <p><strong>Martin works as a doctor... but none of his clients made it. Poor Martin... T_T</strong></p>
    <p>Don't worry, though—Martin says they're just 'resting.' Maybe one day, they'll wake up... maybe. 👀</p>
    <img src="Family Guy.jpg" alt="Mike" height="600">
    <strong><p>Mike is a well-loved man—a family guy, a loving father, who just came in for some back pain. After his visit to Martin, he’s still loved... just maybe in a different way. Here’s Mike’s glowing recommendation for Martin as a doctor. (He highly recommends him—hear it for yourself!)</p></strong>

    <strong>Well, that’s one way to ‘rest’ your back. Anyone else up for Martin’s care? 😏</strong>
