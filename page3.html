    <h3>This is Maya. She loves visiting the neighbors because she feels lonely.</h3>
    <img src="Maya.jpg" alt="Maya" height="800">
    <h3>She enjoys peeking through their windows to see what they are doing. She says she’s keeping them safe.</h3>
    <img src="Robert.jpg" alt="Robert" height="800">
    <h3>This is Robert. The police found him hanged by some balloons. It's awkward, right? Maya says it happened because she didn’t keep an eye on him, and now she feels guilty. Poor Maya.</h3>
    <h3>But don’t worry. Maya says she won’t take her eyes off his wife to keep her safe, of course! :D</h3>
    <h3>She even took a picture of his wife without her knowing, looking through the window. What a sweetheart, right? ;) </h3>
    <img src="Wife.jpg" alt="Wife" height="800">
    <h3>Every night, she sings to Robert's wife before she goes to sleep. Maya knows how lonely she feels after Robert is gone. :)</h3>
    <h3>Listen to her sing. She understands how it feels to be alone, so she sings to keep the wife company and help her stay healthy and safe. :D</h3>
    <h3>She sings the song her mom used to sing to her before she passed away. :D</h3>

    <h3>Maya sings to her every night before bed, knowing exactly when she's in bed.</h3>
    <h3>As for the wife? Maya says she’s so thankful that she cries from joy every night.</h3>
    <h3>She even screams at Maya to stop, because she’s so grateful and doesn’t want to be a burden. But Maya? Maya says she won’t stop. She won’t leave her alone. She knows how it feels, right? :D Maya sees it as a vocation. :)</h3>
